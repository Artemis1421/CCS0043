	One of the most expensive camera gear of the LTT Linus Tech Tips Media Group is their <img src="red.png" alt="red" width="150px" height="150px" style="float: left; padding: 5px"> Red Weapon 8k Camera that starts price at $80,000.00, not including the peripherals. A camera that shoots 8k footage that takes up approximately 125 GB per minute. For some reason, Linus had this crazy idea to take the Red camera <img src="apart2.png" alt="apart" width="150px" height="150px" style="float: right; padding: 5px"> apart and watercool it. The project became a mess and it took 2 years before they finally commit to finishing it up and doing it properly. The final result was definitely worth it as it didn't had anymore issues with the thermals <img src="results.png" alt="results" alt="apart" width="150px" height="150px" style="float: left; padding: 5px">  but the counterpart is that it would weigh a little bit more and have to be cautious so that the water doesnt leak throughout the camera and destroy it.
