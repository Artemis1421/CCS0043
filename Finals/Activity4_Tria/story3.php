	Linus Sebastian, the CEO of LTT Linus Tech Tips was invited to a meetup convention at LTX 2017 wherein he is asked to do a couple of interviews, reveals and showcase. His highlight was his review for the <img src="razer.png" alt="razer" width="125px" height="125px" style="float: left; padding: 5px"> brand new release Razer Blade Pro (2017).
	Linus is famous for dropping stuffs in and out of the video. He usually handles products with one hand making it unstable and dangerous. He did it in the showcase of the laptop at the convention. <img src="drop2.png" alt="drop2" width="125px" height="125px" style="float: right; padding: 5px"> This is one of the moment that Linus knew, that he f'ed up. As the laptop spilled, fell and slammed to the ground, the crowd went wild and Linus felt embarassed and laughed it off. <img src="works.png" alt="works" width="125px" height="125px" style="float: left; padding: 5px"> The moment of truth is when opening the laptop,  thankfully it survived and booted up.
