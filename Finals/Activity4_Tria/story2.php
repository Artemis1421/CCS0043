	There's a makeover video that Linus Sebastian, the CEO of LTT Media. It is sponsored by intel, wherein there will be a $5000 makeover of on his employees. 
	Dennis Liao <img src="dennis.png" alt="dennis" width="150px" height="150px" style="float: right; padding: 5px"> was the lucky one to get picked. Dennis is a "practical" man and made sure that he will get the most out of his makeover. But once Linus sees the receipt, <img src="receipt.png" alt="receipt" width="150px" height="220px" style="float: left; padding: 5px">he was surprised at the random things that he bought. Dennis bought more peripheral and random quality of life items rather than focusing and upgrading his gaming setup. One of the most random and shocking purchase that Dennis made that made Linus both confused and weirded out was this custom $400 neon light that says <img src="liao.png" alt="liao" width="200px" height="150px" style="float: right;padding: 5px">  Live, Laugh, Liao
